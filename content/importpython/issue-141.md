    + core-python

In this post, we’ll explore the extraordinary growth of the Python programming language in the last five years, as seen by Stack Overflow traffic within high-income countries. The term “fastest-growing” can be hard to define precisely, but we make the case that Python has a solid claim to being the fastest-growing major programming language.

In this post I want to explore some of the key similarities and differences between two popular deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow. Why those two and not the others? There are many deep learning frameworks and many of them are viable tools, I chose those two just because I was interested in comparing them specifically.

- [重新设计 Python 的命名元组](https://lwn.net/Articles/731423/)
    + tuples

Deficiencies in the startup time for Python, along with the collections.namedtuple() data structure being identified as part of the problem, led Guido van Rossum to decree that named tuples should be optimized. That immediately set off a mini-storm of thoughts about the data structure and how it might be redesigned in the original python-dev thread, but Van Rossum directed participants over to python-ideas, where a number of alternatives were discussed. They ranged from straightforward tweaks to address the most pressing performance problems to elevating named tuples to be a new top-level data structure—joining regular tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries, and so on.

Python, being awesome by design high-level and interpreter-based programming language, provides us with many features for the programmer's comfort. But sometimes, the outcomes of a Python snippet may not seem obvious to a regular user at first sight. Here is a fun project attempting to collect such classic and tricky examples of unexpected behaviors in Python and discuss what exactly is happening under the hood!
